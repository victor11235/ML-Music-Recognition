# Music-Recognition
(2018-2019) Applying SVM and RNN in recognizing relaxing music

This is a project I did with my high school classmate in 2018-2019, we applied Support Vector Machine and Recurrent Neural Network methods in order to identify relaxing and non-relaxing music. The sample source code could be found in the appendix section of the paper (original copy unfortunately was lost).
